Create a repository in any source code management tool (preferably GitHub) , with a ReadMe file with table of contents of your project, and provide responses to all the questions below:

1. Project Scope and Business Goal: Clearly define the scope and objectives of
the project.
       o Project Scope: What specific problem, task or opportunity will the
machine learning component address? Ensure that it aligns with the
educational program goals of AWS Academy Cloud Foundations and Data
Engineering, and our course.
      o Domain: Clearly define the domain or industry you are working in.
Understand its key characteristics, challenges, and opportunities. This
includes understanding the specific problem or task you are addressing
within that domain. Include an identification of the stakeholders in the
domain who will benefit from your project. This could be healthcare
providers, financial institutions, or any relevant parties.
       o Literature Review: Conduct a literature review of research papers, case
studies, articles, and books related to the chosen domain. The purpose is
to stay informed about the latest advancements and best practices in the
field. Sources should be current and at least 5 sources should be
documented and summarized.
      o Data Source(s): Identify potential data sources within the domain (see
Canvas for sources). This could include databases, APIs, public datasets,
or data collected specifically for the project. Understand and document the
availability, nature and quality of the data available.
Challenges while choosing the domain and choosing the dataset:

     o Domain-specific Challenges: Highlight any unique challenges or
considerations in the domain, including regulations, ethical considerations
and bias. For example, in healthcare, privacy and data security are of
utmost importance. In Finance, handling imbalanced datasets or detecting
fraud might be key challenges.
     o KPIâ€™s: Determine what KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) And
measures of success are important in the chosen domain. Is it
accuracy, precision, recall, or some other metric? This will set the
stage for the metrics that will be used to optimize models.
