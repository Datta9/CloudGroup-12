Create a repository in any source code management tool (preferably GitHub) , with a ReadMe file with table of contents of your project, and provide responses to all the questions below:


o Project Scope:
            Specific Problem: The project will aim to predict and understand factors influencing passenger satisfaction.This will align with educational goals related to machine learning and data analytics with practical applications in customer service and business strategy.

o Domain:   
            Industry: The project will be situated within the airline industry.
            Stakeholders: Stakeholders will include passengers, airline companies, regulatory bodies, and service providers within the airports.

Literature Review: Conduct a literature review of research papers, case
studies, articles, and books related to the chosen domain. The purpose is
to stay informed about the latest advancements and best practices in the
field. Sources should be current and at least 5 sources should be
documented and summarized.

Data Source(s): 
The below are the potential datasources from where we can gather features required for determining the satisfaction of the customer.
1. Airline Passenger Satisfaction | Kaggle: This dataset on Kaggle contains customer satisfaction scores from airline passengers.
2. Airlines - The American Customer Satisfaction Index: The American Customer Satisfaction Index provides a definitive measure of passenger satisfaction with cause-and-effect analysis. It includes data from 9 major airlines, plus an aggregate of smaller carriers. The 2023 results are based on data collected from April 2022 to March 2023.

3. Maven Churn Challenge | Maven Analytics: This dataset includes airline satisfaction scores for 129,880 passengers. Each record represents  one passenger and contains details about passenger demographics, flight distance and delays, travel class and purpose, and ratings for factors like cleanliness, comfort, and service, as well as overall satisfaction with the airline.

Domain-specific Challenges: 

Data Integration: Integrating data from different sources like customer feedback surveys, social media sentiment analysis, operational flight data, and third-party service ratings can be challenging due to the heterogeneity of data. Each source may have its own format, structure, and quality, requiring significant preprocessing and cleaning efforts.

Privacy Concerns: Collecting and analyzing data related to airline passenger satisfaction may involve handling sensitive personal information. Ensuring the privacy and anonymity of individuals while maintaining the utility of the data can be a significant challenge.

Real-Time Analysis: The need for real-time analysis can pose a challenge, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or when the data is streaming in nature, such as social media sentiment analysis.

Data Quality: The quality of data collected from sources like social media or customer feedback surveys can vary greatly. Issues such as bias in responses, missing data, or inaccurate data can impact the reliability of the analysis.


KPIâ€™s: 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in this context would encompass the utilization of data attributes, the extent of data preprocessing, and the diversity of the dataset. It's crucial to have a wide-ranging dataset for robust analysis. Another significant KPI involves experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to identify the one that delivers the best performance. The optimal model would be the one that most accurately predicts or classifies according to the problem at hand. These KPIs collectively contribute to the successful analysis of airline passenger satisfaction.
